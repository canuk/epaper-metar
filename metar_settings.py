# For the same airports in the same locations on screen, place 12 airports in list. The 13th will be the default airport
# For randomly selected airports, put more than 12 in list. 12 will randomly be displayed, 13th will be default
# If you put less than 12 airports in list, it will pad the missing spots with the default airport above.
